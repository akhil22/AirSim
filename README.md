This is a fork of AirSim providing simulation for Clearpath [Warthog](https://clearpathrobotics.com/warthog-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/)

Clone this repository and build AirSim following the instructions [AirSim](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/build_windows/)  

If you are using linux follow the instructions to build AirSim on Linux.

To use AirSim (warthog Included) in your unreal project follow the instructions [here](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/unreal_custenv/)

If you want to use default blocks envrionment provided with airsim follow [these](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/unreal_blocks/) instructions.

Once you build the project (by following any of the above two instructions) and press play select no when you see the message "Would you like to use car simulation? Choose no to use quadrotor simulation." Instead of quadroter you will see 
warthog in simulation (Work in progress !!).

Look at the file [warthog.py](https://github.com/akhil22/AirSim/blob/warthog/PythonClient/warthog/warthog.py) to understand how to control warthog. this file provides controlling warthog using JoyStick and is under progress and will be updated with detailed instructions.  

Thank You !!
